# Release Guide

## Local package

```bash
npm install
npm run test:coverage
npm run typecheck
npm run make
```

Artifacts will be generated under `apps/desktop/dist/`.

Before non-technical beta users receive builds, macOS and Windows artifacts must be signed,
macOS artifacts must be notarized, and each GitHub release must include SHA-256 checksums.
Treat missing signing/notarization or missing checksums as release blockers for beta and public
distribution.

## macOS signing and notarization

Set these GitHub Actions secrets:

```bash
MACOS_CSC_LINK=
MACOS_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD=
APPLE_API_KEY_BASE64=
APPLE_API_KEY_ID=
APPLE_API_ISSUER=
```

`MACOS_CSC_LINK` should contain a base64-encoded Developer ID Application certificate or secure file URL supported by Electron Builder. The release job maps it to `CSC_LINK`. `APPLE_API_KEY_BASE64` is the base64-encoded contents of the App Store Connect `.p8` private key; the workflow materializes it as a permission-restricted temporary file for notarization.

## Windows signing

Set these secrets:

```bash
WINDOWS_CSC_LINK=
WINDOWS_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD=
```

Unsigned builds are acceptable for local development. The tag release workflow deliberately fails if signing or notarization secrets are absent.

## Checksums

After building:

```bash
find apps/desktop/dist -maxdepth 5 -type f -print0 | xargs -0 shasum -a 256 > SHA256SUMS.txt
```

The release workflow combines all native artifacts, generates `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and creates the GitHub Release. It also checks that the tag, root package, desktop package, contract package, and source contract versions match.

## Suggested release naming

```text
LeagueLore Import Helper v0.1.0

Assets:
- LeagueLoreImportHelper-darwin-arm64.dmg
- LeagueLoreImportHelper-darwin-x64.dmg
- LeagueLoreImportHelper-win32-x64.exe
- LeagueLoreImportHelper-linux-x64.AppImage, .deb, or .zip
- SHA256SUMS.txt
```

## Release verification

Before announcing a release:

1. Install each native artifact on a clean supported OS.
2. Launch with a `leaguelore-import://session` link and confirm league, season, session ID, and token handoff.
3. Complete a sanitized end-to-end preview against the production API.
4. Verify macOS notarization with `xcrun stapler validate` and Windows signatures with `Get-AuthenticodeSignature`.
5. Confirm the packaged fuse report disables Node injection/inspection and enforces encrypted cookies and ASAR integrity.

The manually dispatched **Production upload smoke test** workflow requires approval through the `production-smoke` GitHub environment plus a newly issued one-time `LEAGUELORE_SMOKE_TOKEN` and `LEAGUELORE_SMOKE_SESSION_ID`. It uploads a sanitized minimal ESPN-shaped bundle, prints only the HTTP status, and rejects continuation URLs outside LeagueLore. Run it before promoting a public release; the preview it creates can then be deleted through the normal LeagueLore flow.
